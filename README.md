# reloadwatcher
Prepos-like CLI compiler for common web languages (LESS, Babel, Sass) with Gulp support

## Why?
Because I was bored & live-reload in gulp/prepos was painfully slow after few changes. And I also didn't want to copy-paste gulp script in every folder.

## New modules?
Add them to `/modules` folder.
